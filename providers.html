									<p>Administrative Director</p>

									<p>Hello,</p>

									<p>I am Koreen Dow. I am the old shoe at Waubonsie that is still here after 30+ years. You know, the pair that you have had for a long time. You might change the insole (or management), but the shoe is still sturdy. You might change
										the shoelaces (color, length, style), but that choice is what ties and keeps the shoe together and gives it character. That’s what keeps me at Waubonsie…it is a good fit!</p>

									<p>Like a shoe, I have covered a lot of ground here. I started posting charges, moved on to billing insurance, added doing payroll and human resources, incorporated several software systems throughout the years, thus learned IT,
										ordered supplies, cleaned the office, and was called upon to remove flying bats if necessary. Currently I have the role of Administrative Director, another learning experience for me.</p>

									<p>Outside of the workplace, I have several other shoes that I wear. I have been married for 38 years to my high school sweetheart. We enjoy so many things together… activities with our 2 grown boys, music, sports, golf, attending
										Church, and spending time with family & friends. I love the Iowa Hawkeyes, Chiefs, and St. Louis Cardinals. Always ready to strike up a conversation with anyone about sports if they are willing to listen to me. Working outside
										with flowers, going for walks, and playing the piano are some of my favorite hobbies. Helping and making others happy gives me great satisfaction and something I strive to do every day.</p>

									<p>Caroline grew up in West Wales and moved to US after marrying her husband. One of the first things people often comment on is her accent. Caroline attended Missouri Baptist University in St Louis for both her
										bachelor’s and master’s degrees.</p>

									<p>Caroline approaches therapy with humor, positivity, and a belief that each of us has unlimited potential. One of her favorite phrases is “there are no wrong answers in here.” Caroline will walk alongside each client and meet them
										wherever
										they are at in their journey.</p>

									<p>In her spare time, Caroline loves to travel, read, take trainings and spend time on her front porch. She currently has two cats, one dog, three children and a husband who often shakes his head in wonder at her ideas. Time with
										family
										and
										friends is always a priority to her.</p>

									<p>IHH Care Coordinator</p>
									<p>There is truly something about hope that causes a person to look forward and focus on things that are possible. Hope helps individuals face barriers that have limited their choices and ability to move forward with healthier
										choices. Waubonsie has supported many people in facing the barriers and offered supports to move forward. It is a privilege to be part of a team of providers who promote healthy change, encourage whole health lifestyle, and assist
										individuals in ways to manage obstacles. Being a part of the Waubonsie Integrated Health Home team has broadened my understanding of what a great community we live in, of tremendous resources aimed at meeting the needs of
										individuals, and personally assisted me in growing in my understanding that change is possible for everyone.</p>

									<p>IHH, CSS, SCL Director</p>
									<p>My name is Kevin Christensen and I have been with Waubonsie Mental Health for two years now. I live in Clarinda with my wife and two boys, and I am a 2001 graduate from Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville, MO…GO
										BEARCATS! Over the last twenty years I have primarily worked with youth in residential treatment settings and on probation and spent 12 of those years working in the Admissions office at Clarinda Academy. I have a love for
										traveling and my previous job allowed to me to “officially say” I have passed through 32 different states either by plane or by car. In my off time, I enjoy spending time camping and fishing, and this time of year watching college
										football…I am a huge Iowa Hawkeyes fan. What I enjoy most about this job is watching people succeed with their goals and being able to help with life throws a curveball!</p>
